Welcome to Packer by Hashicorp! 

Packer uses a JSON array to encompass a builder then a series of JSON objects
as provisioners.  The provisioners can be as simple 'file', more complicated 
like the shell to execute commands in BASH or even much more sophisticated 
like Configuration management tools like Ansible or Salt! 

How cool is this tool?!
